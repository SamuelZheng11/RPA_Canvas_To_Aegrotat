This is the shortened for of the README file, a more comprehensive one including high level documentation for the component can be found
in the docx file.

How to run the project
Because setting up the bot and running it on an orchestrator is difficult for marking purposes. The easiest way to see the system 
working is to run it in UIPath. To run it on UIPath simply open UIPath and select the project.json file in the source code folder. 
Once the project is open, ensure that the Main.xaml file is open and run the project from by clicking the “Run File” button on the 
UIPath design ribbon.

Dependencies to External Systems
The main dependency is to the aegrotat system, firefox and Canvas exported file. For the system to work, you need to open an active 
aegrotat application for a student in a course open on firefox, and the canvas exported grades CSV file for that course (this can 
be found under a Canvas course’s Grades tab)
